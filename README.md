# 🏋️ 90-Day Exercise + Lifestyle Plan (Revised)

## 🌱 Daily Routine

### Morning (Strength Training – 20 mins)
Do this circuit daily (no equipment). Repeat **2–3 rounds** depending on energy:

1. **Squats – 12 reps**  
   👉 Stand, feet shoulder-width, bend knees as if sitting, back straight, stand up.  

2. **Push-ups – 10 reps**  
   👉 Wall, knee, or full push-ups depending on ability.  

3. **Glute Bridge – 12 reps**  
   👉 Lie on back, knees bent, lift hips up, squeeze glutes, lower slowly.  

4. **Plank – 20–30 sec**  
   👉 On forearms and toes, keep body straight like a board.  

5. **Side Leg Raises – 10 each side**  
   👉 Lie on one side, lift top leg up slowly, lower back down.  

6. **Arm Circles – 10 forward + 10 backward**  
   👉 Stretch arms to side, draw controlled circles.  

7. **Stretching – 3–4 mins**  
   👉 Neck rolls, toe touch, shoulder stretches.

### Night (Cardio Walk – 60 mins)
- Brisk walk outdoors or indoors.  
- Aim for a pace where breathing is faster but you can still talk.  
- If 60 mins at once feels hard in the beginning → start with 40 mins and add 5–10 mins per week.  

---

### During Workday (Bonus Movement)
- Short walk – **5–7 mins every 60–90 mins**.  
- Walk after lunch – **10–12 mins**.  

---

### Hydration & Sleep
- **Water:** 3–3.5 L/day  
- **Sleep:** ~8 hrs/night

## ✅ Why This Works
- **Strength training (AM):** builds muscle, improves insulin sensitivity, burns fat all day.  
- **Long evening walk (PM):** burns steady calories, helps fatty liver, cholesterol, digestion.  
- **Daily routine (same every day):** easier to follow than split schedules.
